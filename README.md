# Chip26

# How-To <br/>
Download the roms you want to use. <br/>
Run the installer (Windows build) or extract the program to a folder (linux build) and launch Chip26(.exe) with the path of your ROM as the first argument. <br/>
CHIP-8 uses keys 0-9 and A-F for input. In the future, these will be able to be remapped through the config, although the backend required for that already exists.
